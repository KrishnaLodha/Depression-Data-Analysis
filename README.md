# Depression-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting depression risk using machine learning techniques. By analyzing lifestyle and psychological factors, the model identifies individuals at risk of depression and provides personalized recommendations for high-risk groups.  

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and scaling raw data for model training.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers for prediction.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measured model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Generated actionable insights to reduce depression risks.  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes features like:  
- Lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep pattern, screen time, workload)  
- Psychological factors (e.g., homesickness, isolation, mental health history)  
- Depression Risk as the target variable  

The dataset is securely hosted online for easy access during model execution.  

## Libraries and Frameworks  
- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and modeling  
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and metrics  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and scaled numerical features.  
2. **Model Training**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  
   - Trained models with balanced class weights.  
3. **Evaluation**  
   - Analyzed model performance using confusion matrix and classification reports.  
4. **Deployment**  
   - Generated predictions and insights for potential real-world applications.  

## Results  
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy with Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
- **Insights**: Identified significant contributors to depression risks, such as poor sleep and high screen time.
